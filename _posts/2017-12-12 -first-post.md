## What's up
So far my experience in the STEM program has been very stressful I'm struggling in algebra 2, but hopefully with some tutoring I'll get better and improve my grades especially my test grades.
Other than that I enjoy it and I'm grateful I got accepted and am exposed to many oppurtunities I wouldn't even know about if I wasn't in the program.
