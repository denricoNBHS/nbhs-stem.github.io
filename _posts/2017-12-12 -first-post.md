## What's up
So far my experience in the STEM program has been very stressful I'm struggling in algebra two, but hopefully with some tutorng I'll get better and improve my grades especially my test grades.
Other than that I enjoy it and I'm grateful I got accepted and are exposed to many oppurtunities I wouldn't even know about if I wasn't in the program.
