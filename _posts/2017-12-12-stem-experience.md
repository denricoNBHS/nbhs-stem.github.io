My STEM experience so far has been one of the most stressful and amazing experiences of my life. Stressful because it is a lot of 
work, but amazing because of the people you meet and the teachers and mentors that we are given. There is a very great support system
that comes with being in STEM and honestly it's amazing. Also, the program gives each student many oppurtunities. Yes, it is a lot of
work but trust me it is very well worth it.
