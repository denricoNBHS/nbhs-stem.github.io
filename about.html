    currently placed with 3 Cohorts!

<h2> Our Purpose </h2>
<p> The purpose of our program is to prepare our students for a future
    in S.T.E.M. with an exposure to all the different fields as well as the skills to be successful. 
    Students who complete the 4-year program will not just receive credit for one of the most rigorous
    cirriculums out there, but will have experiences and oppurtunities that will allow them to differentiate 
    from their peers.
</p>

<h2> Our Program Goal </h2>
<p> The goal of the program is to offer an accelerated 
    and demanding curriculum for our most gifted and talented students 
    who are considering attending highly competitive colleges and universities. 
    The Program will also give the students exposure to many different fields, 
    using a variety of educational expediencies, to find their ideal niche.
    This will eventually lead to the students entering higher education 
    with a sense of confidence in their future studies.

    students todayâ€”especially in science, technology, engineering and math." President Barack Obama, September 16, 2010
